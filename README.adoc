Be more productive than ever with this simple project that uses the https://spring.io/blog/2015/06/17/devtools-in-spring-boot-1-3[spring dev tools]
and https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader[react hot loader].

Everything from backend to frontend will automatically reload.

See http://geowarin.github.io/spring-boot-and-react-hot.html[my article] for an in-depth explanation.

## Developing

The spring boot project is the gradle top-level project.
The frontend sub-project contains the javascript code.

Installing the npm dependencies:

```
./gradlew frontend:npmInstall
```

Now you can simply launch the spring boot application with the `dev` profile
with the flag `--spring.profiles.active=dev`

## Shipping

This command will generate an optimized bundle and include it in the jar.

```
./gradlew clean assemble
```

You can then launch it with:

```
java -jar build/libs/boot-react-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

With spring boot 1.3, you can install the application http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/deployment-install.html#deployment-service[as a linux service]
